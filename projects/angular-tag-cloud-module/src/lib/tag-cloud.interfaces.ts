   * In fact passing just one word to the array has the effect that this is relative to other elements.

   * with the class `w5` - right in the middle of the discret scale.
   * The given value for `weight` is not directly mapped to the CSS-class.
   * For example you can use also a value like `123` or `34` - it will always be mapped to a scale from 1 to 10
   * relativly to the other array elements.
   * If you don't want that the tag cloud is calculating the values manually,
   * set the `strict` property to `true` and use integer values `1` to `10` within the `weight` property.
